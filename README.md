# location-based-knowledge-graph
Project in Melbourne

This is the project directed by Dr Qi and A.Prof Zhang.

Based on OpenStreetMap, I extract the information of the landmarks and match them with the information parsed from Wikipedia, inorder to select those "real" landmark (namely more well-known) and show with their informtion to users.
